The code is for LPC1768 to read three same K30 CO2 sensor to collect some information about CO2 density. 
We can use developer.mbed.org to compile this documents.

To communicate with three sensors, we use TxRx serial interface in our code.

Thanks Kun Su, an undergraduate student in our group for this part of the code.
