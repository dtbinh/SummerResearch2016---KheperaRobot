The code is prepared for LPC 1768 micro-controller, and it need an online compiler to compile the code.
we can find the compiler on developer.mbed.org

this time, we use a different CO2 sensor: COZIR GC0008, which is sold out then.
http://www.co2meter.com/collections/co2-sensors/co2-sensors, we can find another version of that sensors on this website.

Thank to our undergraduate student Kun Su, who wrote this code.
